//! Reading the allocation set and indexer endpoints from our own nuthatch nest.
//!
//! Until now `allocations.rs` fetched both from the network subgraph **through Edge & Node's
//! gateway, with their API key**. That is the critical path for paid probing: no allocation refresh
//! means no `collection_id` to bill, which means direct probing stops. An oracle whose independence
//! rests on someone else's API key is not independent, and GRC-009 claims otherwise on our behalf.
//!
//! Everything that path provided is on Arbitrum as events, and `nuthatch-org/horizon-nest` indexes
//! them: `AllocationCreated/Resized/Closed` on the SubgraphService for the allocation set, and
//! `ServiceProviderRegistered` for the endpoints.
//!
//! ## Why this does not simply replace the gateway path
//!
//! A nest that is still backfilling answers queries perfectly well and returns a *partial*
//! allocation set. Swapping that in wholesale would silently shrink the probe target list — every
//! indexer the nest has not reached yet would look like it has no allocations, and would quietly
//! stop being measured. That is the same failure this whole project exists to catch, so
//! [`NestClient::allocations`] refuses to answer at all until the nest says it is current.
